WEB SCRAPING 

In this repository you can find functions for web scraping, based on a search query. The found content is saved in a csv format file. Note that not all sites allow web scraping, so you should check it first. 
This repository also contains functions for downloading tweets for text analysis, text preprocessing and topic labelling using BERTopic.
